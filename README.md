#Face It Duke

##Overview

This project is an experiment I'll be working on this summer.  Using OpenCV, python 3, and sqlite3, I will attempt to create an app that, given a photo of any Duke student, will be able to recognize that student and display basic information about him/her.  I have no idea if OpenCV is capable of this, or if I'll have access to enough training data for this to work - but I won't learn without trying.

##Details

Don't expect to see any significant progress on this until late June, when I'll really have a chance to get into it.  Right now, I'm just laying down the project framework.

##Why I'm Doing This

Because I want to see if I can.  Also, if I pull it off, I'm pretty interested in how people would react.
